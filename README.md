### Self-Assessment:
In week 1 of our project, my role was to organize meetings for the team and help brainstorm. I was able to invite a guest who works as a manager in the medical field to tell us about the challenges and the questions that rise when dealing with Covid-19. Additionally, my team and I agreed to assign me to complete the database side of our project. In this phase I had to search data online, clean it, convert it to csv files then provide a provisional database that mimics the expected final database. I was also able to provide an initial diagram schema as well to help connect our project to the vision. <br/>
<br/>
In week 2, I was able to put together the database that stores data and connect five tables using SQL database and used five joints. I was also able to use pandas to clean and join some tables to the database. I also did not forget to update and provide the ERD with relationships. My teammate and I worked collaboratively to exchange data and provide SQLAlchemy connection strings.<br/>
<br/>
By week 3, the database portion of the project was complete, so I continued organizing team meetings and we continued discussing our final product before the presentation. We were so happy and excited to see the progress we made and enjoyed the visual final product we came up with!<br/>
<br/>
Choosing the Covid-19 topic was a good choice considering the wealth of sources and data available, however I was frequently challenged to find the specific data that will support our project; therefore, I had to constantly look online and seek my teammates help and suggestions. Also, I had some technical issues with PgAdmin that was time consuming and a challenge to finish the work smoothly. As a solution I had to uninstall it and install it. <br/>
<br/>
The Berkeley Bootcamp was a very intense journey and throughout the course I learned a lot. The final project was a great opportunity to boost my confidence in the database and analysis field and test my can-do attitude and capability. It was lots of work but it was fulfilling to see the progress and learn from the hands-on learning and practice. <br/>
<br/>
### Team Assessment:
This project gave me the opportunity to work with very professional and respectful teammates. Cristina, Doug. Drew and I were working as one with a spirit of teamwork. We assigned work based on our technical passion and strengths. Every member was willing to provide information and contribute. The good communication and the mutual respect made the process smooth and fun despite the heavy load of work. We were able to meet and connect with each other via Zoom, Slack and emails. We did not depend on the class sessions to update each other. <br/>
<br/>
After we decided to choose the Covid-19 topic, we were faced with the challenge of finding the suitable data and had to change our topic questions based on the data available. We also changed the selected machine learning module many times due to the absence of complete and comprehesive data.<br/>
These challenges were alleviated through mutual team support.<br/>
<br/>
### Summary of Project:
We collected data around the COVID-19 epidemic to understand its impact and predict future cases. We used the ARIMA and VAR model and achieved a 81% accuracy predicting cases would rise in July 2020. We also used Tableau to provide data visualizations about our study. <br/>
